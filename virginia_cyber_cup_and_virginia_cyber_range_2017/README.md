The writeups in this directory are for both the Virginia Cyber Cup 2017 CTF and the challenges hosted by the Virginia Cyber Range. 
I completed many of them during the CTF event, which is why I want to make writeups, but since these problems are also being hosted 
as wargames, keep in mind that if you're interested in working through the Cyber Range problems yourself, you may not want to use 
these writeups as guides unless you're REALLY stuck or have no idea what to do. The point of wargames is to teach yourself new things, 
and if you take away the struggle of working through the problems yourself you'll rob yourself of the learning process.
